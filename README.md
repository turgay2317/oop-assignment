<h1>Space and Planets Information System (SPIS)</h1>
It was an assignment for Objected Oriented Programming lesson in 2nd year 1st semester assignment at Gazi University. We designed and developed a space-planet system.

<h3>The main questions is that "What percentage of probability can any living species live on any planet?"</h3>

* Basically that system contains <b>Live (as animal, bacterium), Planet (as giant earth, terrestrial planet, hot planet) and PlanetSystem</b>.
* Living forms have minimum and maximum values to live, for example Animal can live at these temperatures between -50 and +50 centigrade. 
* PlanetSystem class calculates probability of living, for various live types and various planets.
* PlanetSystem class has reference live and reference planet
* We defined that references as; Human and Earth
* All of our process will go ahead remembering these references.
* Space Vehicles go target planets to calculate probability of living

<h3>Future of App</h3>
<ol>
<li>Scaning planets according to distance</li>
<li>Adding new planet to system</li>
<li>Creating a random planet</li>
<li>Editing an exists planet</li>
<li>Calculating probability of live for planets</li>
<li>Comparing different planets</li>
</ol>
